Virtual Silk
============

Requirements
------------

The Virtual Silk project is designed for the Leap Motion controller (<https://www.leapmotion.com/product>) and Oculus Rift DK2 (<https://www.oculus.com/en-us/dk2/>). The following software packages are required to set up a build environment.

*   Unity 5: <http://unity3d.com/get-unity>
*   Leap Motion SDK: <https://developer.leapmotion.com/downloads>
*   Oculus Rift SDK: <https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/>


Installation
------------

1.  Download the Leap Motion Core Assets for Unity/C# from <https://developer.leapmotion.com/downloads/unity>.
2.  Create a new 3D Unity project.
3.  Click *File > Import Package > Custom Package...*
4.  Find the Core Unity package and import it.
5.  When the assets are done importing, close Unity.
6.  Merge this project folder (after cloning or downloading) and the new Unity project folder. (This can be done by copying all files, including the .git folder, into the Unity project folder, so that the Assets folder from this project is merged with the Assets folder of the new Unity project.)
7.  Restart Unity and reopen the project.
